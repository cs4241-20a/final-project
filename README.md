## Minesweeper versus
- Team Number: 5
- Team Members: Joseph Cybul, Isabel Morales, Orlando Pinel

## Project Description
 
Our team has decided to produce and online versus version of the classic game minesweeper. The game will place two players in a "room" so they can compete to deactivate their mines before their opponent, if both opponents fail, the winner will be determined by who found more mines before detonating one. The players will be able to communicate via a chatbox on the gamescreen. The players will need a profile that will include their amount of games played and their victories, with a global leadbord of win ratio.

## Project Architecture

The frontend will be written in JavaScript and the server in Node.js will implement the express framework, with web pages written in HTML and styled with a CSS template. The server will coordinate the game functionality and data storage using SQL databases to store username, password, global leadboard(username and win ratio), games played and games won.


## Targeted Users

This versus version will be based on the most succesful game in history according to TechRadar so the game is targeted at a large audience, basically to any pair of friends or competitors that wish to compare their sweeping skills. Anyone can play the game as long as they understand the game's mechanics and have someone to play against.

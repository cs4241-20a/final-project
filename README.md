# Team 26 - Paddle Ball Super Smashem
##CS4241 Final Project
https://pbss.glitch.me/

## Team
We have a group of four people: 

- Sadie Lombardi
- Hezekiah Owuor
- Mattheus Nascimento
- Edward Philippo

## Project Description
Our project “Paddle Ball Super Smashem” is a game of virtual ping pong. Players can chat with each other and view their win/loss ratio on their profiles. We use node.js and express for the server, three.js for the game, and socket.io for the chat.

To play: Use “W” and “S” keys to move up and down and try to hit the pong ball into your opponent’s goal.

## Project Ideation
Our stakeholders in this project are those at WPI who feel they would like to connect with others but don't have the opportunity to due to the Coronavirus.
Our project will create a platform for playing a fun game and chatting that can be shared safely from home. 

## Technologies Used
Body parser - Used to send data to and from server to be stored in a json object.
Express - Server connection to database and serving of files.
Mogodb - Database storage and login as well as storing win/loss ratio for the 
Socket.io - Used for multiplayer chat functionality
Three.js - Used to create virtual pong game

## Challenges
We really wanted to put multiplayer functionality in this game, and tried to do it using socket.io. Unfortunately even though we were able to establish a connection between players, we couldn’t make this work. We had some challenges with collision problems at a later stage in the project, which took up most of our time. We also ultimately had trouble trying to create a chat

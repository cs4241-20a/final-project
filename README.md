## FAQs

- **Can I use XYZ framework?** You can use any web-based frameworks or tools available, but for your server programming you need to use node.js. Your client-side language should be either JavaScript or TypeScript.

1. Our project is a pong multiplayer game with high score charts


**Instructions to play the game**

1. Connect to https://ljcook-rmcirella-vebuyck-final-project.glitch.me/ and select a name, then press the start button

2. Also do the exact same thing on another computer

3. ***VERY IMPORTANT STEP*** if you want to run the game again, you have to restart the server. The only way I know how to do this on glitch is by making a small change in the server.js (like an indent) so it restarts.

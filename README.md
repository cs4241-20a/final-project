## Final Project Summary and Walkthrough
We created a chatbot application where a user can ask questions about the 
WPI admissions process. These questions and answers were found and compiled 
from the WPI website. From this information, we made a dataset to pull answers
for frequently asked questions about WPI and admissions.
The user first provides some basic information 
to the application consisting of their full name, email, and date of birth.
This information is then sent to the server after being entered, where
it is stored in a database as their user information. The user can then 
click the continue button to proceed to the chatbot. Once on that page, the 
user can click on the red recording button and ask the chatbot verbally any 
question they have about the admissions topics listed on the page. 
Note that when speaking to the chatbot, you must speak slowly and clearly. The 
conversation between the user and the chatbot is then displayed on the screen 
as a text conversation. In this case, the user is a high school student
who is interested in learning more about WPI and WPI's application process. 

## Technologies Utilized
We utilized MongoDB as our database to store the user's information.
We also used a CSS styling format called Wing. The link to Wing is
found in both html pages. Another technology we used was every function
we implemented, mainly in script.js, that allow the site to access the 
mic of the device, process the verbal response, and pick out key words
to answer a question correctly with the chatbot. In addition to this, we also
generated speech for the chatbot's responses. 

## Challenges
One of the main challenges we faced was trying to get the Enter button
on our userinfo page to both upload information to the server and then the database,
and also proceed to the chatbot page. We were unable to successfully do this. 
To accomodate this, we placed a Continue button to proceed to the next page.
We also had some issues with actually getting the user's data to store in the database.
We were able to overcome bugs and errors to make this work correctly after some
debugging. Another challenge was that there was only two of us working on the project. 
Because of this, our project scope was narrowed. 

## Group Breakdown Of Work
We both worked on the chatbot together (js code). 
Nicole focused on the CSS of the project and Lara focused on the database/server side code.
We both helped with debugging of our code as well.

## Design and Tech Achievements
Some design and tech achievements we had were actually implementing the verbal and 
auditory portions of the chatbot. We had never covered this in class, but
it was something we really wanted to accomplish and learn about. It was very interesting 
and cool to impletement a voice to text chat bot. We also 
were able to display all of the audio recorded on the screen in text bubbles. 
We also added chatbot images to show when the user or the chatbot was speaking.
We styled the page with WPI colors, while also utilizing Wing as our main CSS 
style model. We were able to process user data through the server and to the
database. Neither of us had any skills in front end coding before the 
beginning of this course, and we were able to apply what we learned in the course to 
create a really cool application. Our knowledge grew tremendously over the past
7 weeks.

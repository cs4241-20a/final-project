## Proposal

We are creating a web application that finds the songs, artists, and genres that specified users have in common across all their public Spotify playlists. This app will contain static web content and design, dynamic JavaScript behavior, a Node.js server, and a real-time global chat functionality. We will be leveraging the Spotify API to obtain the requested data, as well as a database to store chat messages.

This application is intended to be a fun, unique way to connect socially, especially during COVID-19 times. This project would provide a music-based social media interaction that could foster more connections, as well as strengthen existing connections by providing content people have in common. Intended users for this project are anyone with a Spotify account, and stakeholders may be anyone looking to use music as a basis for social interaction and connection.

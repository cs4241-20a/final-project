# Project Outline:
Working Title: Meeting Organizer
Using this web application, users can input their credentials and their availability (prefered and possible) in order to schedule concrete meeting times. This web application also allows users to send invites for these meetings times to the group’s emails. A chat feature allows group members to give more information about their availability.
Stakeholders of this project would include anyone who needs to schedule a meeting without knowing everyone’s availability (ie. students, co workers, group members, various organizations). Our application will streamline the process of finding and scheduling times for a meeting.

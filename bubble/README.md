## Proposal Feedback
This sounds fantastic. I'll point out that it would also be great for group work in courses. The Zoom "breakout room" feature is super inflexible and clunky, having something like this that let me pop in and out of different conversations more easily would be great!

So, you'll want to use peer-to-peer for the video streaming via [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org).

Here's a [helpful library](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer) for this.

Good luck and let me know if you have questions!

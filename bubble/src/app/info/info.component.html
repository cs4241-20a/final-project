    To join an existing call, type the name of the bubble corresponding to the
    call in the “join an old bubble” and press the plus sign. Currently, you will
    only be able to join “one”, “two”, or “three”. If we were to extend our application, we would implement the ability to join any of the bubbles shown above the text entry boxes by typing their name into the box.

    To create and join a new bubble, please enter the name of your new call in the
    “new bubble” box and press the plus sign.

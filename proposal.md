### Deliverables

__Proposal:__

  We will be creating an online conference website.  
  Features will include joining a room with other users, streaming video with audio, and/or chatting.  
  We will use WebRTC to transmit the real-time data, and MongoDB for data permanence.  
  Users can create accounts with a username and password. Users can have private chatrooms that will persist over time.  

  Team: Noah Parker, Sean Morrissey, Rory Sullivan, Eric Reardon, Malek Elshakhs

We plan on creating a Group Grocery List. This grocery list can help avoid conflicts, reduce food waste, and track consumption. The group choses a login group name and password to access their list of groceries. The users can add/delete/edit the group's groceries. We also plan on including a chat for the group.

Optional Additions to the project:
- Include details about soup kitchens
- Notify users about the upcoming holidays
- Have a cart list and a fridge list with a reminder for upcoming expiry dates
- Suggest recipes based on the groceries in the fridge list
- A trash can to throw away groceries virtually
- A list of items which can be donated

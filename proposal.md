## One Word / One Sentence Story Maker
Each user can see the previous word/sentence, and tries to continue the story by adding their own word/sentence

The application is essentially a live Mad Libs with other people on the Internet!

Users can start a story by specifying a word/sentence count limit (up to a hard limit)  

One story will be created at a time, every user that comes to the site will contribute to the current story until it is finished, then the next story will start. Newly created stories will enter a queue until it’s their turn to be created

Once the cap is reached the story is saved and posted

Users can read and vote on previously saved stories, a display page will show each story’s name and upvotes (maybe more info?) and clicking on a story will show the user all story information on its own page

Other features that we would like to add: story objects store authors, time completed, (maybe time started or duration?), story up to the current point, (isWord boolean if we choose to make it toggleable), isFinished boolean, upvotes (0 if in progress), contributor list, (maybe skipping number, aka 2 other people must contribute before you can contribute again?)

Target audience would be people that enjoy participating in light-hearted story creations and just want to have a good time with others. The demographic will likely be a younger audience.

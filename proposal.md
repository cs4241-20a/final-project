League of Legends is a video game where people select characters, or champions, and play a 5v5 tower defense game. Drafting is a vital aspect of this game that can make or break a game. We seek to create a drafting simulator to help people practice this. This would consist of having two different clients interact directly to make pick, and to ensure that these picks are made in time. 

The players would connect to a specific draft "room" with a certain ID and be assigned either Blue or Red side. After this the picks will begin and after each pick is made, it will be sent to the other player so that they may make their pick based off this.

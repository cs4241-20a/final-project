# Connect 4 
  Our application will be a two player connect four game. Players will be able to log on and play with other users waiting to play. We will implement a turn based system that will follow the traditional rules of connect four. For the front end we will have two main screens. The first page will allow the user to define a username and create/join a game. We will ensure that two users with the same name can't be logged on at the same time. The next screen will have the game with a basic grid and an indicator of whose turn it is. The backend will handle incoming moves and sending moves. We will need to use mongoDB to store the board state and the online players.

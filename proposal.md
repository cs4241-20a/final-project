# Project Description:
A website designed for teams to collaborate in planning tasks. The website will have a login page which allows users to create an account tied to an existing service. 
There will be a home page where the user can see what groups they are a part of and make a new group. Once a group is made they can invite users by entering their username.
The homepage will also have a list of tasks approaching their deadline or that are overdue.
Once the user is part of a group they can click the group and go to their group's page which will contain a list of tasks (multi-column format). 
This list of tasks can be added to, modified and items can be deleted or marked completed. 
The tasks will have a name, due date, task type and assigned user(s) in which either the team or a user or group of users can be assigned a task.
This page will also have a live chat window in which team members can speak to one another.

## Project Proposal:

We will create a website that allows users to create accounts in order to log their physcial activity and workouts. The intended users of this website are novice to beginner weightlifters, specifically those with little to no gym experience.

Through an input form, a user will be able enter the date of their workout, the muscle group, the exercise name, a rep count / rep to fatique measurement, and the weight amount.

Website accounts will allow users to store their data, and sort past workouts based on any of the input categories.

For realtime communication, users will have the ability to chat / message other accounts.

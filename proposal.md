### Proposal
  Our proposed application is a version of a Battleship with a chat feature as well as a friend and a lobby system. The game would have a login screen as the landing page with a welcome quote to the game of Battleship. Upon logging in (or registering), your information will be registered into the database which will also store player information. Logging in will allow you to view your history, create a lobby, or join a lobby. Creating a lobby will generate a unique password which can be sent to another for joining purposes. Joining a lobby will require said password. The game history page will showcase the user's statistics such as wins, losses, and total games played. Joining or creating a successful lobby with two players will load the game page which will allow for the game to be played in real time as well as a chat system that will also be in real time. There will be a page or dismissible pop-up for learning how to play. An about us page will also be added to describe the project and host our github links. Simple audio feedback will be played to add immersiveness to the game. Appropriate middleware will be used alongside tech such as MongoDB, NodeJS, Bootstrap, React, etc... For more information on the project planning see below.

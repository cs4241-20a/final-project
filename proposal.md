## Project Kocha

Kōcha (紅茶, こうちゃ), meaning black tea in English, is a project to promote the process of memory by utilizing the forgetting curve to plan the schedule for remembering. 

Inspired by After School Tea Time in _K-On!_, great works should be able to be done in a relaxed and happy way, and memory is no exception. Memory plays an significant role in our learning process and is a critical element for us. The mission of Kocha is to enable people to remember anything they want more efficiently in spare time.

Having a cup of Kocha, have it memorized.

## How to use

1. Users to import entries (e.g. words or formulas)
2. Kocha pushes daily entries that need to be review by the curve and algorithms
3. Users review and mark up whether they are remembered
4. Users can manage and view statistics for the entries already been imported

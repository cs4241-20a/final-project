Pictochat 2: Electric Boogaloo

Pictochat 2 will be an online chat room created in JavaScript that will allow users to log onto the site using an OAuth account, join one of the multiple chat rooms, and be able to draw/type messages to be sent to the chat room in real-time. 

We are roughly trying to create a UI/Product similar to this image below where users may draw images using their mouse along with typing letters with their keyboards and then send those messages in real-time to their communal chat room where other users can view these messages and respond.

Technologies:
We plan to use Socket.io for our real-time communication in the chat room. (Socket.io subject to change)
Node.JS for our backend server with Express to make things simpler
MongoDB for storing user info
Our front-end will be written in plain JavaScript and styled with a CSS library (Probably Bootstrap)
Other libraries will be implemented as needed

Target users/Stakeholders
This site will target nostalgic Nintendo DS users that want to relive their glory days (back in â€˜04)

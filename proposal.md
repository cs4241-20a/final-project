# CS4241 Final Project Proposal

### Group members: Xiaowei Chen, Yaru Gong, Xiaoyue Lyu, Mingxi Liu, Jialin Song
### Project Description: 
Our project is a real-time video commenting website, where users can watch different videos by entering different virtual rooms. Inside the room, users can watch the videos while posting comments and seeing comments including both real-time comments and past comments from other users who are watching or watched the video. This can create a sense of shared watching experience. 
### Project Feature
- Our project will feature user registration and login using Passport.js, as well as OAuth of Github and Google. Any pages other than the register/login page will be protected and can only be viewed by authenticated users.
- Users will be posting comments in real-time and viewing othersâ€™ comments in different screening rooms.
- Users will be able to watch different videos in different screening rooms.
The database will keep the users information, and the comments left by the former users.

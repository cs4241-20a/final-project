Title: Enlighten Me
A web application that presents a controversial topic on the screen and allows users to debate the topic in a real-time chat box. Users will talk about the topic for five minutes and they will choose which category the next controversial topic will come from. Categories include: politics, memes, food, and etc. We will use a database to store the votes. Users must be logged in to vote and use the real-time chat.

Our intended audience/stakeholders are people who enjoy arguing on the internet. 
The project is intended to encourage users to see others’ points of view and debate them.

## Pac Man, but Multiplayer
- Team Number: 13
- Team Members: Jonathan Dang, Ivan Eroshenko, Clay Oshiro-Leavitt, Adrianna Staszewska

## Project Description

For this final project, our team decided to pursue an interactive, online, multiplayer game. This game will be based on the pop culture classic, Pac Man, albeit with multiple players active in a single game environment. So, the idea is that 1 < x  <= 5 people will join a “game-room” and compete with each other for the amount of coins that they can pick during the game. The player with the highest score will win. The global leaderboard is going to show each player’s highest score of a single game.

## Project Architecture

The webapp will be written in JavaScript (both frontend and backend), with web pages written in HTML and styled with various frameworks - NES.css is currently under investigation.
The server will coordinate the game functionality and data storage. For persistent data, we will store users’ high scores to create a leaderboard (username and highest score).

## Targeted Users

This game is designed to appeal to a large audience. The simple mechanics will provide an easy way for new users to rapidly become acquainted with the program. Once people start to play, they can then show their competitive side as they race to be #1 on the leaderboards. Everyone will play this game.

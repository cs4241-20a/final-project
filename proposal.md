**Project Proposal**

**Description:**
A browser home page application that has customizable boxes/categories that users can fill in to have bookmarks, notes, tasks, and images. The idea is that the user will open their browser and use this page to start their day/work/session. The user will be able to log in so that their content persists between sessions. This application is targeted at users who use their computers on a daily basis and would like a customizable web browsing experience. The application will make use of a database in MongoDB to store the homepage layout, input, preferences, etc. 

**Requirements:**
Draggable content boxes (ex. box for bookmarks, notes, tasks, etc.)
Login page, each user will have a different homepage.
Persistent data between sessions
Customization for elements (background color, box size, text size, font style/color)
Github login

**Stretch Goals**
Images in content Boxes
User Chat
Icon (links, headers, in-text)
Google or Facebook Login

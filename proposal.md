# Cheem Chat - Proposal
For too long chat applications like Slack, Discord and Microsoft Teams has underrepresented those of the cheem kind. To solve this injustice we have made a chat app solely for cheems lovers to interact. In this revolutionary site built with JavaScript, Node.js / Express, MongoDB and React, users will be able to send their favorite cheems to each other inside a persistent and communal chat room. With intuitive leaderboard technologies, users will also compete to be the top chatter and attempt to make their favorite cheem top doge.

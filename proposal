Team 2
Nicole Jutras and Lara Padir

Project Proposal:
Team 2 will be creating a chat bot that answers admissions questions about WPI.
A user can log into the application and message the bot to ask these questions.
Our audience is students applying to WPI that have questions about the 
admissions process. We will be working together completely on back-end
development. Lara will be styling the application with CSS, and 
Nicole will be coding the script.js file.
